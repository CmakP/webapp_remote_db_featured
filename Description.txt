A web application that allows users to access a remote database and follows the MVC 
architecture.
Users will have full access to the database table (All CRUD operations are available)
User input will be validated on both the browser and the server side.

Internationalization:
The UI will provide runtime choices of language display

Cookies
Once the user chooses a language their choice will be saved in a persistent Cookie.
When they return to the application in a new session the previous choice will automatically 
be used to set the presentation language

HttpSession
Each database operation will be saved to a Collection of SQL Strings
The Collection is to be added to the session
A separate “summary” page will display the contents of the Collection for review purposes. 

Encryption
When connecting to the database the user will be required to provide a password that will 
be used to decrypt the connection file information.

Filters
A ServletFilter will be used to invoke the decryption process described on the previous slide.
When the first request is made the filter will prompt the user to enter the password.  
If successful the primary presentation will be seen.
If unsuccessful the user will be prompted again.
